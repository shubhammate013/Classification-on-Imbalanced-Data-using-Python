# Classification-on-Imbalanced-Data-using-Python.

In Machine Learning, imbalanced data refers to a situation in classification problems where the number of observations in each class significantly differs. In such datasets, one class (the majority class) vastly outnumbers the other class (the minority class). This imbalance can lead to biased models that favour the majority class, resulting in poor predictive performance on the minority class, which is often the class of greater interest. 


Handling imbalanced data in classification tasks is a challenge that requires careful consideration of data preprocessing, resampling strategies, model choice, and evaluation metrics. Below is the process you can follow while performing classification on imbalanced datasets:

1. Begin by analyzing the distribution of classes within your dataset to understand the extent of the imbalance.
2. Determine the importance of each class in the context of your specific problem.
3. Increase the number of instances in the minority class by replicating them to balance the class distribution.
4. Some algorithms, like tree-based methods, are less sensitive to class imbalance. Consider using these or ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Trees.
5. Besides accuracy, use metrics that are informative for imbalanced datasets, such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, or the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve.
